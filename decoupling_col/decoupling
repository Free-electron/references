  Abstract                 = {In this paper, an effective approach for mitigating the near-field coupling between four-port circularly polarized (CP) antennas in a 30-GHz multiple-input, multiple-output ( MIMO) system is suggested and investigated. This is obtained by incorporating a two-layer transmission-type frequency selective surface (FSS) superstrate based on planar crossed-dipole metal strips. This paper presents a comparison between the mutual coupling when the patches are radiating in free space and in the presence of the FSS layers. The simulated results, when the FSS layers are applied, show an average of 6-12-dB improvement in the isolation between four adjacent CP-MIMO antennas. In addition, an accurate study is carried out on the insignificant reflections produced by the FSS layers to redirect those and also prevent any interference. The proposed 2 x 2 CP-MIMO antenna along with the superstrate is implemented and tested to validate the simulation results. Experimental results of the coupling and reflection coefficients and axial ratio show an acceptable agreement with the corresponding simulated ones.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a wide-scan angle planar patch phased array is proposed. The proposed array is composed of wideband probe-fed microstrip patches placed 0.087 lambda(h) (lambda(h) is the wavelength of highest frequency) above individual ground planes and interlaced with parasitic decoupling walls. In order to cancel the feed probe inductance, the array elements comprise additional degrees of freedom to introduce controllable capacitance. Concurrently, individual ground planes and parasitic decoupling walls are proposed as an effective structure to considerably increase the E-plane scanning angle of the phased array by reducing the magnitude of near-field mutual coupling. A 544-element phased array prototype of the proposed element was designed, manufactured, and validated experimentally. The experimental results agree well with the numerical simulation ones and indicate effectiveness of the proposed design for mutual coupling reduction and wide-angle scanning. Because of the modifications, the measured mutual coupling between adjacent elements is reduced to lower than -32 dB at the center frequency. The proposed phased array has almost a constant active input impedance (active VSWR less than 2 over 20% bandwidth) up to scan angle of 65 degrees in E-plane and 60 degrees in H-plane, with a realized gain reduction of about 3.5 dB.},

  Abstract                 = {A compact decoupling network for enhancing the port isolation between two closely spaced antennas is proposed in this paper. In the network, we first connect two transmission lines (TLs) individually to the input ports of two strongly coupled antennas. The length of the TLs is designed so that the trans-admittance between ports changes from a complex one at the antenna inputs to a pure imaginary one. A shunt reactive component is then attached in between the TL ends to cancel the resultant imaginary trans-admittance. Finally, a simple lumped-element circuit is added to each port for input impedance matching. The even-odd mode analysis is adopted to investigate the currents excited on the antennas for predicting the radiation pattern of the two-element antenna array. Two examples of printed antennas at 2.45 GHz are tackled by using the proposed decoupling structure. The measurement results agree quite well with the simulation ones. High antenna isolation and good input return loss are simultaneously achieved in both cases, which demonstrates the feasibility of the structure. The decoupled antenna array in each example radiates, as prediction, toward different but complementary directions when the input power is fed in turn to the two input ports. The array efficiency is estimated better than 75% in each example. This pattern diversity effect is helpful for reducing the channel correlation in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system.},

  Abstract                 = {A simple ground plane structure that can reduce mutual coupling between closely-packed antenna elements is proposed and studied. The structure consists of a slitted pattern, without via's, etched onto a single ground plane and it is therefore low cost and straightforward to fabricate. It is found that isolations of more than -20 dB can be achieved between two parallel individual planar inverted-F antennas (PIFAs) sharing a common ground plane, with inter-antenna spacing (center to center) of 0.116 lambda(2)(o) and ground plane size 0.331 lambda(2)(o). At 2.31 GHz it is demonstrated that this translates into an edge to edge separation between antennas of just 10 mm. Similarly the structure can be applied to reduce mutual coupling between three or four radiating elements. In addition the mutual coupling between half wavelength patches and monopoles can also be reduced with the aid of the proposed ground plane structure. Results of parametric studies are also given in this paper. Both simulation and measurement results are used to confirm the suppression of mutual coupling between closely-packed antenna elements with our slitted ground plane.},

This array is based on the radiator-sharing approach and the defected ground structures (DGSs). In this phased array, the radiator-sharing approach has been implemented by using metasurface antenna, and the scanning range has been remarkably enhanced by reducing element spacing. An attractive behavior in broadband impedance matching has still been obtained, in spite that closely spaced feedings are adopted. Moreover, the scanning performance is considerably improved by applying meanderline slots cut from the ground plane, forming DGS. In order to validate this proposed design, a nine-element linear phased array with DGSs has been fabricated and measured. Based on the uniform magnitude and the progressive phase, the capability of wide-angle scanning can be achieved over the measured bandwidth of 23.1% (4.6-5.8 GHz). At the center frequency of 5.2 GHz, this array scans up to 50 degrees and the realized gain varies from 14.76 to 11.85 dBi.},

In order to widen the scanning angle of array antennas, this paper investigates unit antenna beamwidth and the coupling effects between array elements, both of which directly affect the steering performance. As a result, the optimal array distance, the mode configuration, and the antenna structure are elucidated. By using the features of the miniaturized mu-zero resonance (MZR) antenna, it is possible to design the antenna at optimum array distance for wide beamwidth. In addition, by modifying via position and gap configuration of the antenna, it is possible to optimize the mode configuration for optimal isolation. Finally, the 3 dB steerable angle of 66 degrees is successfully demonstrated using a 1x8 MZR CP antenna array without any additional decoupling structure. The measured beam patterns at a scan angle of 0 degrees , 22 degrees , 44 degrees, and 66 degrees agree well with the simulated beam patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the role of quantum interference phenomena on the characteristics of the fields radiated by an array of quantum emitters. In analogy to, but distinct from, classical outcomes, we demonstrate that the array geometry empowers control over direction-dependent photon statistics of arbitrary order. Our formulation enables the recognition of configurations providing spatial correlations with no classical counterpart. For example, we identify a system in which the angular distribution of the average number of photons is independent of the number and position of the emitters, while its higher-order photon statistics exhibit a directional behavior. These results extend our understanding of the fields generated by ensembles of quantum emitters, with potential applications to nonclassical light sources.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel physical effect of angular super-resolution based on the direction-of-arrival information sampling using highly oscillatory evanescent harmonics in dense antenna array environment is demonstrated theoretically and experimentally. This phenomenon enables realisation of novel, ultra-compact antenna terminals (ATs) with superdirective radiation patterns and spatial auto-focusing characteristics for any direction of arrival of the excitation waveform. The use of these ATs should enhance the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver, increase overall energy efficiency of the wireless communication or power transmission systems and lead to substantially lower interference and EM pollution across the wireless network area. Special attention is given to the antenna array operating in the presence of a flat metal ground plane or a ground plane with EM band-gap structure. Near-field scattering phenomena arising as a result of the antenna array coupling to the ground planes of both types and their effects on the far-field radiation patterns are analysed in detail. The results of the study should be important for the development of the electrically compact ATs to be employed in the energy-efficient wireless communication systems including the Internet-of-Things, wireless sensor networks and wireless powering systems.},

Due to the difficulty of achieving E-plane coupling while simultaneously controlling the coupling level and phase, there have been few reported E-plane ESPAR antennas in the literature. In this paper, it is shown that these challenges can be overcome by exploiting the cavity geometry to achieve the desired coupling values; the required phase shift is achieved by changing the load impedance of the parasitic cavities. In full-wave simulations, it is observed that the proposed ESPAR E-plane array is able to steer the beam from -30 to 30 degrees, which is comparable to the beam-steering range of ESPAR antennas operating in the H-plane.},

In this work it is demonstrated that these challenges can be overcome by exploiting the cavity arrangement and geometry to control the coupling between cavities. Independent E-and H-plane beam steering control is achieved by dynamically changing the load impedance of corresponding parasitic elements. It is shown that this ESPAR cross array is able to steer the beam from -24 to 24 degrees in the E-plane and -20 to 20 degrees in the H-plane; the demonstrated beam steering performance in either plane is comparable to ESPAR antennas only able to operate in a single plane.},

  Abstract                 = {The growing demands for wireless communications in tunnel environments are driven by requests for maintaining uninterrupted internet access for users in tunnels as well as wireless connections for wireless sensors, security, and control networks. Nevertheless, wireless networks in tunnel environments are associated with technical challenges related to elongated wireless coverage in two opposite near-end-fire directions. Here, we introduce a low-profile bidirectional antenna that can be mounted on a large ground plane and that has a dual-magnetic-current mode exhibiting radiation patterns with 3-dB beamwidth coverage at near-end-fire angles. Furthermore, we realized a planar array with eight such bidirectional antennas that were configured as a sparse array in order to reduce the commonplace issues of mutual coupling and grating lobes. The radiation beams of the proposed antenna array can scan in the end-fire area (60 degrees < phi < 120 degrees, 45 degrees < theta < 80 degrees), with scanning gains of 11 similar to 15 dB in the near-end-fire directions. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed array can adaptively generate a directional single beam or multiple beams according to the positions of users, which is suitable for intelligent communication systems with low power consumptions and high communication bandwidths in tunnel environments.},

To increase the field-of-view scanning range of arrays, a compact low-profile antenna with a quasi-hemispherical pattern is introduced firstly. When the ground is infinite, the proposed antenna has a quasi-hemispherical pattern, i.e., an approximately uniform radiation in the upper half space. Afterward, two linear arrays arranged along the length and width of the proposed antenna's radiation patch are presented. The main beams of the two arrays with 16 active elements can scan from less than -75 degrees to more than +75 degrees. When the linear array element number is 128, the maximum scanning angle can reach 86 degrees. At last, a planar array with 16 x 16 active elements is proposed. In two special planes, xz plane and yz plane, the main beams of the planar array can scan from less than -77 degrees to more than +77 degrees with a gain fluctuation less than 5 dB and a maximum side lobe level (SLL) less than -10 dB. An excellent wide-angle-scanning performance both in linear and planar arrays can be obtained using the proposed method.},

It consists of two orthogonal linearly polarized antennas and an auxiliary port loaded with a proper reflective terminal. Besides the direct coupling between two antennas, an indirect coupling path is introduced and controlled by the auxiliary port reflection. The coupling between these two paths will superpose and cause cancellation at the receiving antenna output, while a high isolation between the antennas can be achieved accordingly. For the validation of the proposed SIC, one prototype was designed and fabricated. Good agreement can be observed between the simulated and measured results. A high isolation of 35.9-46.5 dB over the entire working band of (2.40-2.62 GHz) is observed, while the radiation patterns are almost the same for the antenna pairs with and without SIC circuit. Due to the merits of good performances and easy implementation, the proposed SIC technique has potential application for full-duplex transceiver to suppress the self-interference.},

Based on a traditional even- and odd-mode technique, closed-form mathematical equations for both circuit electrical parameters and scattering parameters are obtained. Due to the use of two coupled-line sections placed in the vertical direction, the directivity of this novel coupler without any other compensation techniques can be enhanced while maintaining tight-coupling performance of almost 3 dB. For demonstrative purposes, three typical full-wave simulation examples with realized physical dimensions in microstrip technology are presented, indicating high directivity and tight coupling coefficient. Finally, a practical microstrip coupled-line coupler is designed and fabricated to operate at approximately 2 GHz. The measured results show good return loss, quadrature phase characteristics, high directivity, and strong coupling performances.},

To demonstrate the method, a two-element microstrip antenna array with the proposed network has been designed, fabricated and measured. Both simulated and measured results have simultaneously proved that the proposed method presents excellent decoupling performance. The measured mutual coupling can be reduced to below dB at center frequency. Meanwhile it has little influence on return loss and radiation patterns. The decoupling mechanism is simple and straightforward which can be easily applied in phased array antennas and MIMO systems.},

Two additional resonances can be obtained with the help of the parasitic patches of the antenna. Consequently, a wide impedance bandwidth of 17% (vertical bar S-11 vertical bar < -10 dB) can be achieved. Then, without the increase of the antenna array footprint, the combinations of two decoupling techniques (i.e., metalized via walls and short-circuited stepped-impedance structures as the neutralized networks) are adopted for mutual coupling reduction when the antenna element is extended to 2 x 1, 2 x 2, and even 4 x 4 array applications. To validate the design idea, a 2 x 2 antenna array is fabricated and tested, whose measured isolations between any two feeding ports are better than 28 dB within the frequency range of 3-4 GHz. The measured peak gain fluctuates from 12.6 to 13.6 dBi within the 10-dB impedance band of 3.35-3.95 GHz, and the cross-polarization levels in both the E- and H-planes are lower than -38 dB at the boresight direction.},

  Abstract                 = {Decreasing the mutual coupling between Multi-input Multi-output (MIMO) antenna elements in a mobile handset and achieving a high data rate is a challenging topic as the 5th-generation (5G) communication age is coming. Conventional decoupling components for MIMO antennas have to be re-designed when the geometries or frequencies of antennas have any adjustment. In this paper, we report a novel metamaterial-based decoupling strategy for MIMO antennas in mobile handsets with wide applicability. The decoupling component is made of subwavelength metal/air layers, which can be treated as singular medium over a broad frequency band. The flexible applicable property of the decoupling strategy is verified with different antennas over different frequency bands with the same metamaterial decoupling element. Finally, 1/100-wavelength 10-dB isolation is demonstrated for a 24-element MIMO antenna in mobile handsets over the frequency band from 4.55 to 4.75 GHz.},

  Abstract                 = {Utilization of electromagnetic band-gap (EBG) structures is becoming attractive in the electromagnetic and antenna community. In this paper, a mushroom-like EBG structure is analyzed using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. Its band-gap feature of surface-wave suppression is demonstrated by exhibiting the near field distributions of the electromagnetic waves. The mutual coupling of microstrip antennas is parametrically investigated, including both the E and H coupling directions, different substrate thickness, and various dielectric constants. It is observed that the E-plane coupled microstrip antenna array on a thick and high permittivity substrate has a strong mutual coupling due to the pronounced surface waves. Therefore, an EBG structure is inserted between array elements to reduce the mutual coupling. This idea has been verified by both the FDTD simulations and experimental results. As a result, a significant 8 dB mutual coupling reduction is noticed from the measurements.},
